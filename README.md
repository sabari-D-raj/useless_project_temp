## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Team Two]


### Team Members

### Project Description
An app that listens to 10 seconds of a song through a microphone and plays it back.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever heard a really good 10 seconds of a song and forgot the replay button exists? We fixed that, totally.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So to put an end to this infuriating problem (that no one has ever faced), we've decided to make an app that will simply listen to 10 seconds of a song and replay it back at you, with even worse quality than before.
