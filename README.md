### Project Description
An app that listens to 10 seconds of a song through a microphone and plays it back.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Ever heard a really good 10 seconds of a song and forgot the replay button exists? We fixed that, totally.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
So to put an end to this infuriating problem (that no one has ever faced), we've decided to make an app that will simply listen to 10 seconds of a song and replay it back at you, with even worse quality than before.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Language - Python
- Libraries - scipy, sounddevice, tkinter
- Tools - ChatGPT

For Hardware:

- Microphone (built-in)
- Speakers/headphones

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation

# Run
python singasong.py 

### Project Documentation

Replaying back those glorious 10 seconds but you can't hear it since we're doing something audio based.

### Project Demo
# Video
[Add your demo video link here]
The video is showing the process in which the app records and replays the audio.
